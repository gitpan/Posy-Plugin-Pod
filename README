==== NAME ====

Posy::Plugin::Pod - Posy plugin to convert POD files to HTML


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.40'' of Posy::Plugin::Pod.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

This uses the Pod::Simple::HTML module to convert the the POD (Plain Old
Documentation) in a .pm or .pod file into HTML. This expects the
file_extensions to have been set so that files with appropriate extensions
(such as .pm or .pod) will have been set with a file-type of 'pod'. This
then converts entries of the 'pod' type.

This replaces the 'parse_entry' method, and calls the parent method for
anything other than POD.

This also replaces the 'get_title' method used by Posy::Plugin::EntryTitles,
so if one is using that module, one needs to put this after that in the
plugin list.


==== REQUIRES ====

    Posy
    Posy::Core
    Pod::Simple::HTML

    Test::More
